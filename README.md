# car-portal-Bootstrap4-
Recently released Bootstrap V4 Beta got me so excited, that i decided to incorporate it into a simple but effective car search and news portal.

One of the significant changes in Bootstrap V4 for me were new components, sush as Cards. Cards give us the ability to create modern and responsive layouts.
They've also added new button styles and colors, layout was changed to flexbox and other cool stuff.
